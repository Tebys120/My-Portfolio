I aim to be a true professional in what I am passionate about, and that is programming. I am a student of Software Development Engineering, I love learning and bringing to life the things I imagine. I greatly enjoy the process of organizing and putting together a project, and one of the things I long for the most is to one day have the ability to work with and lead an entire team of colleagues, to be a leader, and above all, a better person. I highly value loyalty and the weight of words, and I find comfort when anything I have put effort into comes to fruition.</p>
